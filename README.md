## Overview
This project is a responsive task management app designed with a soft pastel aesthetic and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, track, and manage tasks, featuring interactive sections and forms that adapt well to both desktop and mobile devices.

The styling emphasizes user-friendliness with a pastel pink and brown color palette, rounded corners, and subtle animations to create a pleasant user experience.

- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Form Validation**: Input fields are validated before submission to ensure accuracy.
- **Interactive UI**: Animations and hover effects enhance the user experience.
- **Task Status**: Mark tasks as completed and visually distinguish completed tasks.
